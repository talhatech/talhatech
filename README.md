# Glad you're here! 👋

I'm on a journey to polishing fullstack development skills. With 4+ years of web development experience for global businesses, I offer technical expertise.

Since earning my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. During this duration, I have led web development projects for clients in diverse industries including technology, manufacturing, hospitality, F&B, retail, and financial services.

Being a self-taught developer I'm committed to learning something new every day. I also love to share what I've learned with fellow coders on the same journey. While I love to solve real-world problems, I'm hugely interested in Amazon Web Services and I'm tackling that next!

### Aspiration

I don't spend much time anguishing over tech stack. Whatever tech stack provides the least resistance is the way I prefer to roll. My main goals as a Web Developer, are to identify clients' pain points and satisfy what his/her needs.

### Avocation

In my downtime, I like to create content for Instagram and Linkedin, where I share my day to day learnings. I recently finished #100 days of coding challenge on IG and I am part of many tech communities there.

I'm also an avid reader & enjoy participating in running events.
